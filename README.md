`bezier_kit` is a comprehensive Bezier Path library written in Dart.

## About

`bezier_kit` has been manually converted from the original
[BezierKit in Swift](https://github.com/hfutrell/BezierKit).
It's based on the fork of [BezierKit ref 11a87c26](https://github.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/commits/11a87c261d03ac4d0a7c8d20595b841e5307e8cb)
from June 28 of 2022 (version 0.15.0).

## Features

- [x] Constructs linear (line segment), quadratic, and cubic BÃ©zier curves
- [x] Determines positions, derivatives, and normals along curves
- [x] Lengths of curves via Legendre-Gauss quadrature
- [x] Intersects curves and computes cubic curve self-intersection to any degree of accuracy
- [x] Determines bounding boxes, extrema,
- [x] Locates nearest on-curve location to point
- [x] to any degree of accuracy
- [x] Splits curves into subcurves
- [x] Offsets and outlines curves
- [ ] Comprehensive Unit and Integration Test Coverage
- [ ] Complete Documentation

## Installation

Dart

```shell
dart pub add dart_lapack
```

Flutter

## Usage

### Constructing & Drawing Curves

`bezier_kit` supports cubic Bezier curves (`CubicCurve`) and quadratic Bezier
curves (`QuadraticCurve`) as well as line segments (`LineSegment`) each of which
adopts the `BezierCurve` protocol that encompasses most API functionality.

```dart
import 'package:bezier_kit/bezier_kit.dart';

final curve = CubicCurve(
  p0: Point(x: 100, y: 25),
  p1: Point(x: 10, y: 90),
  p2: Point(x: 110, y: 100),
  p3: Point(x: 150, y: 195),
);

final canvas: Canvas = ...        // your graphics context here
final draw = Draw(canvas);
draw.drawSkeleton(curve: curve);  // draws visual representation of curve control points
draw.drawCurve(curve: curve);     // draws the curve itself
```

### Intersecting Curves

The `intersections(with curve: BezierCurve) -> [Intersection]` method determines each intersection between `self` and `curve` as an array of `Intersection` objects. Each intersection has two fields: `t1` represents the t-value for `self` at the intersection while `t2` represents the t-value for `curve` at the intersection. You can use the `ponit(at:)` method on either of the curves to calculate the coordinates of the intersection by passing in the corresponding t-value for the curve.

Cubic curves may self-intersect which can be determined by calling the `selfIntersections()` method.

```dart
final intersections = curve1.intersectionsWithCurve(curve2);
final points = intersections.map((i) => curve1.point(at: i.t1));

draw.drawCurve(curve: curve1);
draw.drawCurve(curve: curve2);
for (final p in points) {
  draw.drawPoint(origin: p);
}
```

### Splitting Curves

The `split(from:, to:)` method produces a subcurve over a given range of t-values. The `split(at:)` method can be used to produce a left subcurve and right subcurve created by splitting across a single t-value.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lepsch/bezier_kit/main/images/usage-split.png" width="256" height="256">

```dart
draw.setColor(color: Draw.lightGrey);
draw.drawSkeleton(curve: curve);
draw.drawCurve(curve: curve);
final subcurve = curve.split(from: 0.25, to: 0.75); // or try (leftCurve, rightCurve) = curve.split(at:)
draw.setColor(color: Draw.red);
draw.drawCurve(curve: subcurve);
draw.drawCircle(center: curve.point(at: 0.25), radius: 3);
draw.drawCircle(center: curve.point(at: 0.75), radius: 3);
```

### Determining Bounding Boxes

```dart
final boundingBox = curve.boundingBox;
draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve: curve);
draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve);
draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.pinkish);
draw.drawBoundingBox(context, boundingBox: curve.boundingBox);
```
