`bezier_kit` is a comprehensive Bezier Path library written in Dart.

## About

`bezier_kit` has been manually converted from the original
[BezierKit in Swift](https://github.com/hfutrell/BezierKit).
It's based on the fork of [LAPACK ref 11a87c26](https://github.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/commits/11a87c261d03ac4d0a7c8d20595b841e5307e8cb)
from June 28 of 2022 (Around LAPACK version 0.15.0).

## Features
- [x] Constructs linear (line segment), quadratic, and cubic BÃ©zier curves
- [x] Determines positions, derivatives, and normals along curves
- [x] Lengths of curves via Legendre-Gauss quadrature
- [x] Intersects curves and computes cubic curve self-intersection to any degree of accuracy
- [x] Determines bounding boxes, extrema,
- [x] Locates nearest on-curve location to point
- [x] to any degree of accuracy
- [x] Splits curves into subcurves
- [x] Offsets and outlines curves
- [ ] Comprehensive Unit and Integration Test Coverage
- [ ] Complete Documentation

## Installation

Dart

```shell
dart pub add dart_lapack
```

Flutter

## Usage

### Constructing & Drawing Curves

`bezier_kit` supports cubic Bezier curves (`CubicCurve`) and quadratic Bezier curves (`QuadraticCurve`) as well as line segments (`LineSegment`) each of which adopts the `BezierCurve` protocol that encompasses most API functionality.

```swift
import BezierKit

let curve = CubicCurve(
    p0: CGPoint(x: 100, y: 25),
    p1: CGPoint(x: 10, y: 90),
    p2: CGPoint(x: 110, y: 100),
    p3: CGPoint(x: 150, y: 195)
 )

 let context: CGContext = ...       // your graphics context here
 Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve)  // draws visual representation of curve control points
 Draw.drawCurve(context, curve)     // draws the curve itself
```

### Intersecting Curves

The `intersections(with curve: BezierCurve) -> [Intersection]` method determines each intersection between `self` and `curve` as an array of `Intersection` objects. Each intersection has two fields: `t1` represents the t-value for `self` at the intersection while `t2` represents the t-value for `curve` at the intersection. You can use the `ponit(at:)` method on either of the curves to calculate the coordinates of the intersection by passing in the corresponding t-value for the curve.

Cubic curves may self-intersect which can be determined by calling the `selfIntersections()` method.

```swift
let intersections: [Intersection] = curve1.intersections(with: curve2)
let points: [CGPoint] = intersections.map { curve1.point(at: $0.t1) }

Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve1)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve2)
for p in points {
    Draw.drawPoint(context, origin: p)
}
```

### Splitting Curves

The `split(from:, to:)` method produces a subcurve over a given range of t-values. The `split(at:)` method can be used to produce a left subcurve and right subcurve created by splitting across a single t-value.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/master/images/usage-split.png" width="256" height="256">

```swift
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.lightGrey)
Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve: curve)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve)
let subcurve = curve.split(from: 0.25, to: 0.75) // or try (leftCurve, rightCurve) = curve.split(at:)
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.red)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: subcurve)
Draw.drawCircle(context, center: curve.point(at: 0.25), radius: 3)
Draw.drawCircle(context, center: curve.point(at: 0.75), radius: 3)
```

### Determining Bounding Boxes

```swift
let boundingBox = curve.boundingBox
Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve: curve)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve)
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.pinkish)
Draw.drawBoundingBox(context, boundingBox: curve.boundingBox)
```

### More

BezierKit is a powerful library with *a lot* of functionality. For the time being the best way to see what it offers is to build the MacDemos target and check out each of the provided demos.

## Testing

`bezier_kit` includes the entire test suite from the original sources converted
from Swift to Dart.

To run the test suite do:

```shell
dart test
```
